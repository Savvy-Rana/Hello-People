# Tuples-List element can not be changed
#List start and end with [ ] BUT Tuples start and end with () and separated with ,

# for ex:

t=(1,2,3,4,5, "hello")
t=t+(3,6,9)
print(t)
print(t[1])
w=t[2:]
print(w)
print (6 in t)      # chech if 6 is part of the list
print(7 in t)       #check if 7 is part of the list
